Project: ROV Ref App v2 (GitHub Pages)

Tech rules:
- Use plain HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript only.
- No frameworks, no build step, no backend.
- Keep it mobile-first and fast.
- Data lives in /data/*.json.
- Assets in /assets/*.
- Use relative paths that work on GitHub Pages under a repo subpath.

Coding style:
- Readable > clever.
- Small functions with clear names.
- Every file starts with a short comment header: what it does + how to edit (important).
- Avoid duplicated layout: use shared helpers in /js/app.js.
- When making changes, prefer editing complete files, not snippets.
